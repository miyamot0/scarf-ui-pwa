  "QuestionInstruction": "Social validity measurement includes assessments of shareholder beliefs about the acceptability and/or importance of goals, outcomes and/or procedures of the study. Shareholders could include anyone impacted by the intervention, including individuals receiving intervention or those they are connected to (e.g., parents, teachers, administrators). Shareholders could also include community members who may have some indirect connection to a study's participants or knowledge about the study's goals, outcomes, and/or procedures (e.g., asking speech-language therapists about the acceptability of a language intervention or importance of its outcomes).",

For example, in an intervention where teachers are taught to implement an intervention, a “maintenance” condition might refer to a final condition where teachers do not receive coaching but children are still receiving the intervention. In this case, teacher behaviors would be scored a \"yes\" (i.e., the coaching had been removed), but child behavior would be scored a \"no\" (i.e., the teacher intervention was still in place). For some cases would be selected when maintenance occurs for some but not all tiers in a multiple baseline or multiple probe design.",
