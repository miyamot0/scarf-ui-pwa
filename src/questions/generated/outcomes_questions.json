  "QuestionStem": "Is the dependent variable for this design the primary dependent variable, or a secondary dependent variable?",
  "QuestionInstruction": "Primary dependent variable: Variable on which decisions were made for this design. For example, when teaching teachers to implement an intervention with fidelity, and measuring teacher and child behaviors, teacher fidelity is often the primary variable on which decisions are made. Secondary dependent variable: Any non-primary variable. (e.g., generalization measure, corollary measure, exploratory measure, measure that changes secondary to the primary variable such as child change secondary to adult fidelity). Historically, authors have poorly reported which variables are primary versus secondary. It might be helpful to have rules for designating primary when not explicitly reported. For example, when both fidelity (implementer) and resulting behavior (participant) data are collected in the context of a single case design, you might designate fidelity as the primary variable and the participantâ€™s resulting behavior as secondary.",
