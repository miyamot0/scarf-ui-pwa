Outcomes,Outcomes_1,"Is the dependent variable for this design the primary dependent variable, or a secondary dependent variable?","Primary dependent variable: Variable on which decisions were made for this design. For example, when teaching teachers to implement an intervention with fidelity, and measuring teacher and child behaviors, teacher fidelity is often the primary variable on which decisions are made. Secondary dependent variable: Any non-primary variable. (e.g., generalization measure, corollary measure, exploratory measure, measure that changes secondary to the primary variable such as child change secondary to adult fidelity). Historically, authors have poorly reported which variables are primary versus secondary. It might be helpful to have rules for designating primary when not explicitly reported. For example, when both fidelity (implementer) and resulting behavior (participant) data are collected in the context of a single case design, you might designate fidelity as the primary variable and the participantâ€™s resulting behavior as secondary.",PrimarySecondaryUnknown,en-us
Outcomes,Outcomes_2,"Do authors list a criterion for ending intervention or is there another apparent 'ideal'?  If not, select 'N/A' for the next question.","For example, do authors list a growth, learning, or mastery criterion? For example, the ideal might be 100% correct for academic interventions, while an engagement criterion might be at least 80% on-task behavior in a session.",YesNo,en-us
Outcomes,Outcomes_3,"If there is a criterion or ideal, was it met?","For designs with multiple potential responses (e.g., multiple baseline across participants, multiple probe across behaviors), select ""yes"" if criteria were met for a majority (more than half) of potential demonstrations or specify how you determined whether criterion was met in the colum to the right and report this in your written reports.",YesNoNotApplicable,en-us
Outcomes,Outcomes_4,"For this variable, how would you characterize the change between conditions, using visual analysis?","Countertherapeutic = Changes in this behavior were in a direction that suggests worsening (e.g., increased challenging beahvior, decreased engagement) for most or all potential demonstrations. Null = There were no consistent changes in this behavior, suggesting no impact of intervention on behavior occurrence for most or all potential demonstrations. Inconsistent = Some null or countertherapeutic impacts occurred, with some weak or strong effects. Weak = No null or countertherapeutic effects, but at least one effect was ""weak,"" including changes that are unexpectedly delayed, small with overlapping data between conditions, or variable with overlapping data between conditions. Strong = Therapeutic effects occurred for all potential demonstrations. See design-specific examples on ""Visual Analysis Examples"" tab. Inconsistent is NOT APPLICABLE for ATD/AATD.",ConditionChangeCharacterization,en-us
Outcomes,Outcomes_5,"If maintenance was measured for this variable, how would you characterize maintained outcomes?","Countertherapeutic = Maintenance data suggest worsening in comparison to baseline for most or all potential demonstrations. Null = Maintenance data suggest data are similar to baseline for most or all potential demonstrations. Inconsistent = At least one potential demonstration shows null or countertherapeutic impacts, with some weak or strong effects. Weak = No null or countertherapeutic effects, but at least one effect was ""weak,"" including maintenance data that are improved relative to baseline but that are worse or worsening compared to intervention data. Strong = Maintenance data that show clear improvements relative to baseline and that are similar to intervention levels for all potential demonstrations.",ConditionChangeCharacterizationNA,en-us
Outcomes,Outcomes_6,"If generalization was measured in relation to this variable, how would you characterize generalized outcomes?","Countertherapeutic = Generalization data collected during or after intervention implementation are worse than those data collected during or before baseline. Null = There were no consistent changes in this behavior between pre/baseline data collection and during/post intervention, suggesting no impact of intervention on behavior occurrence for most or all potential demonstrations. Inconsistent/Unclear = some null or countertherapeutic impacts occurred, with some weak or strong effects or data were only collected post-intervention so comparisons are not possible. Weak = No null or countertherapeutic effects, but at least one effect was ""weak,"" including small or variable changes in generalized data between pre/baseline and post/intervention. Strong = Consistent and clear differences between pre/baseline and post/intervention data for all potential demonstrations for generalization outcomes..",ConditionChangeCharacterizationNA,en-us
