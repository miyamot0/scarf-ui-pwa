                        The purpose of this tab is for researchers to identify
                        the purpose of their review, and to establish criteria
                        for their review that allows them to take their specific
                        contexts into consideration. For example, a researcher
                        assessing interventions for severe challenging behavior
                        might find fewer data points per condition adequate, due
                        to ethical or safety reasons, while a researcher
                        assessing interventions fo academic skills might require
                        at least five data points per condition.
