## Overview of SCARF-UI Program and Support

This section of the webapp provides instructions and guidance related to the use of the SCARF-UI webapp. This section specifically is intended to provide an initial starting point for those interested in using the SCARF-UI for their research. This guide is **not** intended to provide a comprehensive training in all matters related to SCD research synthesis and instead focuses on **intended use** for the SCARF-UI tool. The information provided on this page is intended to be a high-level overview of the SCARF-UI program and its core functionalities.

For questions related to the SCARF or specific training on SCARF, we recommend fully reviewing the SCARF-UI documentation or reaching out to the developers of the approach ([jennifer.ledford@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:jennifer.ledford@vanderbilt.edu)). Additionally, for those interested, formal training and workshops related to SCARF are occasionally made available to interested researchers.

For more support related to SCARF-UI program errors (e.g., crashes, unexpected errors), please contact the SCARF-UI development team ([sgilroy1@lsu.edu](mailto:sgilroy1@lsu.edu)).

### Relevant Sections of Application

The SCARF-UI has three core sections (i.e., "pages") that each provide information and functionality specific to SCARF. These include the **Data Entry** section, the **Instructions** section, the **Reliability** section, and the **Archives** section. Not all of these sections are relevant to conducting novel research; however, but they each contribute to working within the broader framework (e.g., the Archives are more relevant to review).

Each section is described in more detail below.

#### Data Entry Section

The Data Entry section is the most relevant and functional part of the SCARF-UI. In general, all data that can be entered into the SCARF-UI will be entered, updated, managed, and/or exported from this page. It is most likely to be to page where active users spend the majority of their time.

The Data Entry section is where users can input data, view data, and manage data. It is the primary interface for interacting with the SCARF-UI and is essential for conducting research. It is on this page where users will import/export data, code respective studies, and manage the coding process. It is also where users can view and analyze data, making it a central hub for research activities.

As a point of clarification, the **Primary** and **Reliability** coders for a given project will each work _separately_ in their own browser with their own Data Entry page.

#### Instructions Section

The Instructions section provides guidance on how to use the SCARF-UI effectively. It includes step-by-step instructions, tips, and some best practices for data entry and management. **This section is essential for new users to familiarize themselves with the tool**. Additionally, it may contain links to external resources for further learning as well as guidance for more advanced practices (e.g., exporting SCARF data to be visualized in another tool). The Instructions section is designed to help users understand the features and functionalities of the SCARF-UI. It provides a comprehensive overview of how to navigate the tool, enter data, and manage research projects. The instructions are organized into various topics and subtopics, making it easy for users to find the information they need.

#### Reliability Section

The Reliability section focuses on evaluating the consistency and accuracy data entered into the SCARF-UI between different users and over time. It provides tools and metrics for assessing the reliability of the data, ensuring that users can trust the information they are working with. This section is crucial for researchers who need to ensure the integrity of their data as well as publish their research in peer-reviewed outlets.

In addition to calculating reliability, the Reliability section of the webapp highlights areas of disagreement among coders and prompts discussions to resolve these disagreements. As a matter of convenience, the SCARF-UI reliability section has functionality that assists with updating data sets conveniently as discussions about coding take place. This is designed to support coders reaching 100% agreement across 100% of records in a given review.

#### Archives Section

The Archives section serves as a repository for past datasets and research outputs (i.e., the results of past SCARF reviews). This section allows users to access historical data, which could be useful for referencing previous work to illustrate the end result and/or supporting effects to systematically extending prior research synthesis. This section is important for maintaining a comprehensive record of research activities and findings. This section is also useful for sharing data with other researchers and collaborators if interested in more exposure to open science practices.
