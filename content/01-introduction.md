## Planning to Use the SCARF-UI

The SCARF-UI is essentially a web-based wrapper around the core methods and procedures emphasized in the original [SCARF](https://ebip.vkcsites.org/scarfv2/). In this sense, the SCARF and SCARF-UI are largely identical apart from how data is organized and visualized. The SCARF-UI is designed to be a more user-friendly and accessible version of the original SCARF, which was primarily a spreadsheet-based tool.

Like the original SCARF, there are recommended practices and procedures to follow prior to importing/coding studies. A brief, general outline of the steps reflected in the web-app are described below.

### Establishing the Core Review Protocol

The SCARF-UI is both a webapp as well as a _framework_ for reviewing and summarizing outcomes from single-case experimental design studies. As such, many aspects of the webapp feature elements commonly represented in review frameworks (e.g., PRISMA). For this reason, it is recommended that the review team establish a protocol that outlines the core research questions, scope of the review, and the roles of the review team. Additionally, it is recommended that the protocol be pre-registered in a registry to support transparency and reproducibility (see [Tincani et al., 2024](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jaba.2909), for a review).

#### Defining Central Research Questions and Scope of Review

_Not all aspects of SCARF are required_ to be completed and certain aspects of SCARF may be more relevant for certain research questions. For example, some reviews may not require coding for outcomes such as generalization. Most SCARF projects will involve coding for the presence and clarity of functional relationships, but may explore _more than one_ type of response. In a relevant example, a primary outcome may be the reduction of undesired behavior (e.g., severe and challenging behavior) and a secondary outcome could include a desired alternative response (e.g., compliance).

Both the types and definitions of responses being explored using SCARF whould be written out and operationally defined before beginning the review/coding process. _At the present, the software will prompt the user to complete this step before studies can be imported/coded_.

It is strongly recommended that the review team establish a protocol that outlines the core research questions, scope of the review, and the roles of the review team; however, this is not a requirement for using the SCARF-UI app. Users may skip this step (i.e., press the 'Skip' button on the 'Planning' tab) to quickly proceed to data entry and omit this step (Note: all fields will be auto-completed with a 'Skipped Planning' string).

#### Articulating Study Roles and Defining Review Team

It is generally assumed that the review team will incorporate checks to reduce risks of drift and recorder bias. This will often take the form of assigning a core/'Primary' rater as well as another secondary/'Reliability' rater. These roles should be established _prior to_ beginning the review and should include discussions related to risks of bias (e.g., power differences between raters). This should also include discussions of how disagreements will be resolved (e.g., discussions toward consensus, procedures for tie-breaking during discussions).

#### Optional: Preregistration of Protocol

Details included in the protocol are generally consistent with those featured in registered review protocols. Given this similarity, it is reasonable to consider pre-registering the review in a registry before the onset of the review. Pre-registration is increasingly encouraged as an element of publication in certain journals.
