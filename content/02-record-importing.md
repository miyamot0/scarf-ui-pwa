## Importing Records into SCARF-UI

There are multiple approaches to importing study records in the SCARF-UI app. The webapp is designed to be flexible and can be used in a variety of ways to import studies. Each of these ways can be used to import studies, but the most appropriate method will depend on the number of studies being imported and the complexity of the review. Each of the various options can be used either individually or in combination to import studies into the SCARF-UI app.

Several options are presented in the sections below:

### Individual Study-by-Study Import

The simplest and most discrete way to import studies is to add records one-by-one using the "Add" button on the data-entry page. This is a _simple_ way to add studies, but is not recommended for larger reviews because it requires substantial effort on the front end and is highly repetitive. **For smaller reviews, this may be the most efficient way to import studies**. Additionally, these may be more useful in cases where just one or a few studies need to be added to a review (e.g., results of a handsearch of literature).

### Bulk Import (Paste from Spreadsheet)

The webapp allows researchers conducting larger review to import many studies all-at-once using a specialized import widget. This is generally the most efficient way to import studies and is recommended for reviews with more than 10 studies. The import widget is accessed by clicking the "Import" button on the data-entry page.

For users who may initially have information related to relevant studies in a spreadsheet, _this is the most efficient way to import studies_. Additionally, this approach is the most feasible when the review contains many studies as well as studies with multiple outcomes being coded (e.g., a severe behavior outcome plus a communication response outcome). The import widget is designed to be flexible and can be used to import studies from a variety of sources, but is primarily designed to allow copy/pasting from spreadsheet software.

### Duplicating Existing Study Records

As study records are added to the SCARF-UI app, it may be desirable to _duplicate_ individual records to save time and reduce the risk of data entry errors. This is particularly useful when studies share many of the same characteristics (e.g., same author, same publication year, same journal, same values for reporting/internal validity indicators). This also has the potential to reduce various sources of redundancy in the data-entry process. For example, a study with two outcome measures (e.g., severe behavior and a communicate response), these records may differ in outcome but share the same information in other fields (e.g., internal validity, reporting indicators). By duplicating the record, the user can a secondary outcome record without the need to re-enter individual field data.
