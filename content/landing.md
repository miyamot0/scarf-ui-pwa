## Overview of SCARF-UI Program

This section is intended to provide an initial starting point for those interested in using the SCARF-UI for their research. This guide is not intended to provide a comprehensive training in all matters related to SCD research synthesis and instead focuses on _intended use_ for the SCARF-UI tool.

### Relevant Sections of Application

The SCARF-UI has three core sections (i.e., Pages) that each provide information and functionality specific to SCARF. These include the _Data Entry_ section, the _Instructions_ section, the _Reliability_ section, and the _Archives_ section. Not all sections are relevant to conducting research, but are generally useful in working within the broader framework.

#### Data Entry Section

The Data Entry section is the most relevant and functional part of the SCARF-UI. In general, all data that can be entered into the SCARF-UI will be entered, updated, managed, and/or exported from this page. It is most likely to be to page where active users spend the majority of their time.

### Instructions Section

The Instructions section provides guidance on how to use the SCARF-UI effectively. It includes step-by-step instructions, tips, and best practices for data entry and management. This section is essential for new users to familiarize themselves with the tool. Additionally, it may contain links to external resources for further learning as well as guidance for more advanced practices (e.g., exporting SCARF data to be visualized in another tool).

### Reliability Section

The Reliability section focuses on evaluating the consistency and accuracy data entered into the SCARF-UI between different users and over time. It provides tools and metrics for assessing the reliability of the data, ensuring that users can trust the information they are working with. This section is crucial for researchers who need to ensure the integrity of their data as well as publish their research in peer-reviewed outlets.

### Archives Section

The Archives section serves as a repository for past data entries and research outputs. It allows users to access historical data, which can be useful for referencing previous work and systematically extending prior research. This section is important for maintaining a comprehensive record of research activities and findings.

Additionally, the Archives section allows users to quickly examine the capabilities of the SCARF-UI when populated with relevant study data.
